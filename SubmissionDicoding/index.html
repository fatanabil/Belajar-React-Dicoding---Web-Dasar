                  Rawon, a delicious beef stew, is a famous dish of Surabaya.
                  Traditional herbs like lemongrass, chili, ginger, lime leaves,
                  and kluwek or black nuts are added to the slow-braised, tender

                  plebeian dish in the past, but its scrumptious favor soon
                  became popular among the Indonesian royalty!
